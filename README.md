# GhosterMZ

## Version: 1.0.0

### Overview
GhosterMZ is a tool designed to demonstrate how website phishing works. My name is Dique Joaquim, a programmer in JavaScript and Python from Mozambique. I created this tool to challenge and showcase my knowledge. This project was inspired by htr-tech's zphisher (https://github.com/htr-tech/zphisher), which is written in Bash and PHP. GhosterMZ is built using Python with the Flask framework for backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend.

## Getting Started
To use GhosterMZ, you'll need a Linux terminal on either a computer or Android device, along with Python 3 installed. The tool uses Flask and cloudflared for tunneling. Installation is simplified with a Python script that detects your machine's architecture and downloads the appropriate files.

### Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GhosterMZ.git
cd GhosterMZ
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cloudtunnel.py
python ghostermz.py
